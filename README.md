# CO2-Gadget

An easy to build CO2 Monitor/Meter with cell phone App for real time visualization and charting of air quality data, datalogger, a variety of communication options (BLE, WIFI, MQTT, ESP-NOW) and many supported popular sensors.

This repository is mainly addressed at developers. If you are an end user willing to build the CO2 Gadget you will find complete instructions at [my blog](https://emariete.com/en/meter-co2-display-tft-color-ttgo-t-display-sensirion-scd30-2/) including instructions in how to build the hardware and load the firmware very easily, with just two clicks in your browser (without having edit files, compile or install anything on your computer).

# Supported hardware and build

This project support a large selection of ESP32 boards, displays and sensors.

As an example you can find a very detailed tutorial with step-by-step video on how to build a very compact CO2 Gadget with a TTGO T-Display board and a high quality Sensirion SCD30 dual channel NDIR CO2 sensor and support for battery [here](https://emariete.com/en/meter-co2-display-tft-color-ttgo-t-display-sensirion-scd30-2/).

## ESP32 Boards

Supporting any other ESP32 board is very easy. Yoy just have to setup the pines accordly.

These are the GPIOs used by each predefined board:

# Building from repository

## With PlatformIO (recommended)

**Note:** If all you want is to install CO2 Gadget into your board go [here:](https://emariete.com/en/meter-co2-gadget/). You can install it from your web browser and don't need to compile the firmware.

### Install PlatformIO

You can use PlatfomIO CLI or VSCode with PlatformIO GUI (recomended). For installation see [PlatformIO installation instructions:](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/integration/ide/vscode.html).
### Prepare PlatformIO

First you must edit the file platformio.ini to setup your preferences.

If necessary adjust the upload and monitoring port configuration to match your situation.

  ```
  upload_speed = 921600
  monitor_speed = 115200
  upload_port = COM13
  monitor_port = COM13
  ```
  
Save the file platformio.ini

#### Compiling and Installing

I recommend PlatformIO because it is more easy than Arduino IDE. For this, please install first [PlatformIO](http://platformio.org/) and its command line tools (Windows, MacOs and Linux), **pio** command, then connect your compatible board to the USB and run the next command:

```python
pio run pio run -e TTGO_TDISPLAY_SANDWICH --target upload
```
You must replace "TTGO_TDISPLAY_SANDWICH" with the flavor of CO2 Gadget you want compiled and uploaded (they are defined in platformio.ini or you can define your own).

If using PlatformIO **GUI**, to compile and upload CO2-Gadget into your board, press the "Alien head" -> Project tasks -> Choose flavour -> Upload and Monitor .

## With Arduino

**NOTE:**
Currently Arduino IDE is not supported. If you want to compile with the Arduino IDE, you will have to solve includes, dependencies and defines yourself.

I recommend that you use VS Code with PlatformIO. You have many tutorials on the internet, and it is not as difficult at all as it seems.

# Supporting the project
